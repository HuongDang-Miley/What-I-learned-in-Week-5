# What-I-learned-in-Week-5
## I learned switch function. It switch is somewhat similar like if function. Though, it's not as versatile like if function
example
~~~

function get (date) {
  switch (date) {
    case 1:
    return "Monday"
    case 2:
    return "Tuesday"
    default:
    return "type a digit from 1 - 7"
    }
}
